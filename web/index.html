        <h2>What is cecibot?</h2>

        <p>cecibot is a bot that helps you circumvent censorship through the channels of everyday communication such
            as e-mail, Telegram, Messenger, and so on.</p>

        <p>The idea behind cecibot is the observation that even under the most repressive regimes, people do need to
            communicate with others, both within and outside of the country. cecibot is trying to exploit this fact by
            making use of those communication channels to circumvent censorship, which are much harder to control or
            shutdown, when controlled by 3<sup>rd</sup> parties.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>How cecibot works?</h2>

        <p>When you request a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> from cecibot, it will either</p>

        <ul>
            <li>try downloading it, if it is a file smaller than 5 MiB;</li>
            <li>or will create a full-height <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> of the web-page.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The advantage of creating PDFs (as opposed to taking screenshots) is that the web-page will be preserved as
            it is: with text being selectable and links being clickable.</p>

        <p>In the future, cecibot will extract the multimedia content from specific web-sites such as YouTube,
            SoundCloud, LiveLeak, and so on, but currently it will only create a PDF of them.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>E-Mail</h3>
            <p>E-mail is the cockroach of the communication tools: it's everywhere and it never dies. If you have any
                secure means to access to your mails (<abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure">HTTPS</abbr>
                access to your webmail [usually indicated by a small green padlock at the address bar of your web
                browser] for instance), you should be able to use cecibot <em>relatively</em> safely.</p>

            <p class="highlighted">Send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:bot@cecibot.com">bot@cecibot.com</a> with the URL of the web-page or
                file you request in the <em>subject</em>, and cecibot should reply you within few minutes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Telegram</h3>
            <p>Telegram is used extensively in Iran to fill the lack of WhatsApp and Messenger, and in many other places
            around the world for various reasons. Telegram offers easy-to-use
                <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">APIs</abbr> for developers to develop bots and cecibot
            works smoothly on it.</p>

            <p class="highlighted">Send a message containing a URL to <a href="https://telegram.me/thececibot">@thececibot</a> on
                Telegram.</p>

        <h2>Donations</h2>

        <p>Keeping cecibot afloat costs me around $17 per month (on top of all the effort spent & risks taken), and I'd
            gladly appreciate any contribution that can help me keep the infrastructure running.</p>
